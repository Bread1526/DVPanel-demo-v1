# DVPanel Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local in the project root and fill in your actual values.
# .env.local is ignored by Git and should contain your secrets.

# --- Critical for Session Security ---
# Used by iron-session to encrypt session cookies.
# MUST be at least 32 characters long. Generate a strong, unique secret.
# Example: SESSION_PASSWORD="a_very_long_random_and_secure_string_for_sessions"
SESSION_PASSWORD=""

# --- Critical for Data Encryption ---
# Used to derive the key for encrypting local .json data files (settings, users, logs).
# MUST be a strong, unique secret. Generate one using e.g., openssl rand -hex 32
# Example: INSTALLATION_CODE="another_strong_random_secret_for_file_encryption"
INSTALLATION_CODE=""

# --- Owner Account Credentials ---
# These are the primary administrative credentials for the panel.
# This account is not stored in users.json and is managed solely via these .env variables.
OWNER_USERNAME="owner"
OWNER_PASSWORD="password"

# --- (Optional) Data Path ---
# Where DVPanel stores its local data files (settings.json, user files, logs).
# Defaults to ./.dvpanel_data/ in your project root if not set.
# Example: DVSPANEL_DATA_PATH="/opt/dvpanel_data"
# DVSPANEL_DATA_PATH=

# --- (Optional) File Manager Base Directory ---
# The root directory that the File Manager API will serve files from.
# WARNING: Setting this to '/' can be a security risk if the server process has broad filesystem access.
# For production, restrict this to a specific directory (e.g., /srv/www or /var/www).
# Defaults to '/' if not set.
# Example: FILE_MANAGER_BASE_DIR="/srv/my_web_content"
# FILE_MANAGER_BASE_DIR=
